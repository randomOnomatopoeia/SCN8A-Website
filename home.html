     <h3>SCN8A Pathogenic Mutations</h3>
     <p>Pathogenic variants at the voltage-gated sodium channel gene, SCN8A, are associated with a
      wide spectrum of clinical disease outcomes. A critical challenge for neurologists is to determine
      whether patients carry gain-of-function (GOF) or loss-of-function (LOF) variants to guide
      treatment decisions, yet in vitro studies to infer channel function are often not feasible in the
      clinic. In this study, we develop a predictive modeling approach to classify variants based on
      clinical features present at initial diagnosis.<sup>1</sup></p> 
      <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>This tool is meant to act as an aid in clinical diagnosis and evaluation. Use of this application is not
        meant to act as a substitute for discussing the patient's disease with a clinician, and the decision of this
        application is not intended to override a clinician's decision, but rather inform the decision-making
        process for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of a patient affected by the SCN8A Channelopathy. If
        you are a caretaker using this tool, please bring the information you obtain here to your clinician before
        making any changes to your child's medications or diet. While these machine learning models are able
        to help guide treatment for the patient, it is important to recognize that these models are not perfect,
        and extra care should be taken in treating patients with low confidence predictions. Additionally,
        treatment is not universal, and clinicians/caretakers should seek to provide the best care possible for
        the patient on an individual basis, even if that diverges from the decisions made by this pipeline. If you
        have any questions regarding this application, please use the contact page. Further information on these models is
        available in (papers).</p>
